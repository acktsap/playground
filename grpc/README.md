gRPC : Google Remote Procedure Calls, pronounced by Jee-Arr-Pee-See

## History

```text
Google has been using a single general-purpose RPC infrastructure called Stubby to connect
the large number of microservices running within and across our data centers for over a decade

Stubby has powered all of Googleâ€™s microservices interconnect for over a decade and
is the RPC backbone behind every Google service that you use today

2015, we decided to build the next version of Stubby in the open
```

## FAQs

### Why should i use it

- Low latency, highly scalable, distributed systems.
- Developing mobile clients which are communicating to a cloud server.
- Designing a new protocol that needs to be accurate, efficient and language independent.
- Layered design to enable extension eg. authentication, load balancing, logging and monitoring etc.

## Can I use gRPC with my favorite data format (JSON, Protobuf, Thrift, XML)

Yes. gRPC is designed to be extensible to support multiple content types

> Just a primary type is protobuf

## How does gRPC help in mobile application development?

GRPC and Protobuf provide an easy way to precisely define a service and auto generate reliable client libraries.\
The clients can take advantage of advanced streaming and connection features which help save bandwidth\
do more over fewer TCP connections and save CPU usage and battery life

## Why is gRPC better/worse than REST?

gRPC largely follows HTTP semantics over HTTP/2 but we explicitly allow for full-duplex streaming.

We diverge from typical REST conventions as we use static paths for performance reasons during call dispatch\
as parsing call parameters from paths, query parameters and payload body adds latency and complexity.

We have also formalized a set of errors that we believe are more directly applicable to API use cases than the HTTP status codes.
