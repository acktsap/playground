# Algorithm

What is algorithm? What is goal of computer science?\
Programming, as an enginner, is solving complexity (time, space, human).
Algorithm is to solving time, space complexity. Especialy, time completixy.

FOCUS on intention, how it's organized. It reveals computational thinking.

There are some well-known algorithm for solving problem.\
Programing is writing code. Code has some great patterns.\
Write those well-known algorithms into patterns.

## Language

Use c-based language like c++, java. Use primitive type and array only if possible.

## Practice

### Pattern

Write and develop your own patterns

### Api

Practice basic api usage like

- Dynamic-Array (ArrayList in java, vector in c++)
- Stack
- queue
- Deque
- Map
- Priority-Queue

### Well-known algorithm

Sorting algorithm

- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort

Searching algorithm

- Binary Search

Using basic data structure

- Bitmask
- SubSum
- Dynamic Array
- Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Deque
- String

Using tree structures

- Binary Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Priority Queue
- Disjoint Set
- Segment Tree
- Trie

Graph
