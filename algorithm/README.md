# Algorithm

What is algorithm? What is goal of computer science?\
Programming, as an enginner, is solving complexity (time, space, human).
Algorithm is to solving time, space complexity. Especialy, time completixy.

FOCUS on intention, how it's organized. It reveals computational thinking.

There are some well-known algorithm for solving problem.\
Programing is writing code. Code has some great patterns.\
Write those well-known algorithms into patterns.

## Language

Use java only. Use primitive type and array only if possible.

## Practice

Write and **develop your own patterns**
