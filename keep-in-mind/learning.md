# Learning

Learn by **practice**

1. Get the big picture (What for?, No alternatives?)
2. Find resources (whatever, even from paper on a ground)
3. Set learning strategy (eg. by implementing scheduling in os).
   If possible, in .envrc of each directory (use direnv)
4. Daily plan (must be specific)
5. Do it daily
