# Engineering

Performance vs Pride

## Programming

The process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task

## Seperation of Concerns

- Minimize modification on a spec changes
- Maximize reuseability

It represents as **SOLID** in OOP

- Single Responsibility Principle : A class should only have a single responsibility. One changes to spec affects to an one class.
- Open-Closed Principle : Open for extension and closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle : Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without modification
- Interface Segregation Principle : Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion Principle : One should depend upon abstractions not concretions (eg. dependency injection)

## Everything is for human

Every tech is for solving some problem.

Human can handle a little information at the same time. Apply KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) on code.

## Engineering Mind

Solve problem **in a effective way**. Increase performence, in a simple way.

Engineering is understanding performance, structure, limits of what you build, deeply

## Questions

- What kind of stuffs need to be changed on spec changes?
- What kind of problem does it solve? No alternatives for this one?
- Is it simple enough? fancy? beautiful?
- Is is effective enough?
