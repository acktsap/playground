# Logging

```text
As personal choice, we tend not to use debuggers beyond getting a
stack trace or the value of a variable or two. One reason is that it
is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and
control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive
than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking
code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than
scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less
time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to
the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that
is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program;
debugging sessions are transient.
