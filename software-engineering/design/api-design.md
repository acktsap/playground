# Api Design

## Common

Keep it simple stupid

Make it consistant (convention over configuration)

Throw exception when and only when function preconditions are broken (eg. i/o, network)

Write test case for it. You have to be a first user of api.

## Java

Return nullable or Optional for no corresponding value.
